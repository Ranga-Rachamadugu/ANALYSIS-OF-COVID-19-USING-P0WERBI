ANALYSIS OF WHO COVID-19 CASES DATA USING POWER BI VISUALISATION TOOL
This topic is regarding analysis of Covid-19 cases and deaths where data is extracted from WHO
(World Health Organization) repository.
Covid-19 is a slow-killing virus that affects the human lungs, weakens them, and causes death. Sore throat, 
cough, fever, headache, bodily aches, and loss of smell and taste are all common symptoms. Corona Virus 
is another name for it. Teenagers have the highest recovery rate, whereas elderly adults over the age of 50 
have the highest death rate. Doctors suggest that one should boost his immune system by eating a good 
diet on a daily basis and remaining safe at home quarantines with frequent precautions and preventive 
measures. 
The Corona Virus was disseminated over the world in a variety of methods. The entire planet is now 
suffering greatly, with numerous fatalities occurring over time. Every day, three types of ratio ratings are 
recorded: new cases, recovery rate, and new fatalities. For the time being, let us focus on new instances 
rather than new fatalities for a country.
Here we developed a model to analyse number of cases and deaths occurred and increase rate in cases, 
deaths with respect to time(days from beginning). Three main factors are Suspected S, Infected I,
Recovered or Removed R and analysis is done using SIR Model, we took those values on induvial basis 
and combined them based on cumulative, normalised functions.
